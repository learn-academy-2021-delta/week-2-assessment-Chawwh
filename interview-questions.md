# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is moving through each index in an array or repeating an action until a condition is met! An example I can give you is for loops! for loops will continue 'iterating' until it acomplishes its goal and is met with a false statement.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The parameters for .map() are value, index, and array in that order! value is the sole required parameter for this function while the other 2 are optional. Typically when you use .map() you're wanting it to return a value, most likely manipulated in some way! ^-^

3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is taking an object... and destructuring it... I'M KIDDING! ...Sort of. Object destructuring is creating a variable as a pathway to a key or keys within an object! I like to think of it as a simple shortcut  to the keys I want to reference.

4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: I actually found the differences between classes and objects super interesting! So classes are used as sort of a template for creating objects. It's super cool!! I would assume if you wanted to create like a playable character a user can customize for a game you would use constructor() to set dynamic keys that take input like 'name', 'height', 'hair_color', 'hair_length' etc. and then create functions to take that input and use it to build the character!

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is something javascript does where it recognizes a function by storing it in what I'm guessing is RAM and calling on it technically before it's declared. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me just yet since we know javascript reads code from top down.
