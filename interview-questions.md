# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is moving through each index in an array or repeating an action until a condition is met! An example I can give you is for loops! for loops will continue running until it acomplishes its goal and is met with a false statement. 

  Researched answer: Iteration is a fancy tool for repeating tasks. It sure comes in handy when wanting to move through every index of an array!



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The parameters for .map() are value, index, and array in that order! value is the sole required parameter for this function while the other 2 are optional. Typically when you use .map() you're wanting it to return a value, most likely manipulated in some way! ^-^

  Researched answer:  .map() takes in the parameters value, index, and array. Value is required. index and array are optional. This function creates a new array from the result of the array it was called on.

3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is taking an object... and destructuring it... I'M KIDDING! ...Sort of. Object destructuring the difference between waiting in line for 40 minutes at a waterpark or spending a little extra for line-skipping and tube valet. They both take you to the same place, but one is much faster!

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is creating a variable as a pathway to a key or keys within an object! It's just a shortcut really! 



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: From my understanding methods are functions that live within an object! methods are also capable of taking other functions as arguments

  Researched answer: Methods operate on data located inside of a class. Methods also cannot be executed without first calling its class while functions are perfectly fine to invoke when executred.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: I actually found the differences between classes and objects super interesting! So classes are used as sort of a template for creating objects. It's super cool!! I would assume if you wanted to create like a playable character a user can customize for a game you would use constructor() to set dynamic keys that take input like 'name', 'height', 'hair_color', 'hair_length' etc. and then create functions to take that input and use it to build the character! 

  Researched answer:  Classes are templates for objects. Classes cannot be manipulated while objects can. Aaaaand classes are named using PascalCase while objects use camelCase!



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting is something javascript does where it recognizes a function by storing it in what I'm guessing is RAM and calling on it technically before it's declared. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me just yet since we know javascript reads code from top down.

  Researched answer: Hoisting is when javascript 'saves' variables and functions so they can be executed before the appear in the code. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: class inheritance is a way for one class to expand upon another. Like a .push() but for classes

2. React: React is a front-end javascript library and is used for building user interfaces! (omg do we get to build legit apps?!)
<!-- Ew this is owned by facebook too -->
<!-- I'M KIDDING I'M KIDDING pls hire me fb -->

3. React state:  React state is an object that holds some dynamic data

4. React lifecycle methods: constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() are built in methods used to monitor the lifecycle of components

5. DOM: 'Document object model' A representation of HTML elements in a webpage using a flow chart
